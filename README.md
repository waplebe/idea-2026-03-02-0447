# Simple Task Manager API

**Description:**

This project provides a simple RESTful API for managing tasks. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The frontend provides a basic interface for interacting with the API.

**Why it's useful:**

A task manager is a fundamental tool for productivity. This API provides a foundation for building more complex task management applications or integrating task management functionality into existing systems.

**Installation:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github/your-username/simple-task-manager.git
    cd simple-task-manager
    ```

2.  **Set up the backend:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up the frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the following:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///tasks.db
    ```

**API Endpoints:**

*   `GET /tasks`: Retrieves all tasks.
*   `GET /tasks/{id}`: Retrieves a specific task by ID.
*   `POST /tasks`: Creates a new task.  Request body should be a JSON object with `title` and `description` fields.
*   `PUT /tasks/{id}`: Updates an existing task. Request body should be a JSON object with `title` and/or `description` fields.
*   `DELETE /tasks/{id}`: Deletes a task.

**Examples:**

*   **Create a task:**
    `POST /tasks`
    Request Body:
    ```json
    {
      "title": "Grocery Shopping",
      "description": "Buy milk, eggs, and bread"
    }
    ```
    Response:
    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Grocery Shopping",
      "description": "Buy milk, eggs, and bread",
      "completed": false
    }
    ```

*   **Get all tasks:**
    `GET /tasks`
    Response:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Grocery Shopping",
        "description": "Buy milk, eggs, and bread",
        "completed": false
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Pay Bills",
        "description": "Pay electricity and internet bills",
        "completed": true
      }
    ]
    ```

**Features:**

*   **Add Tasks:**  Users can add new tasks with a title and description using the "Add Task" button.
*   **Complete/Undo Tasks:** Users can mark tasks as complete or undo completion.
*   **Real-time Updates:** The task list updates dynamically after adding, completing, or undoing tasks.

**Testing:**

*   **Unit Tests:**  (To be added - placeholder)  Unit tests will be added to verify the functionality of the API endpoints and frontend components.
*   **Integration Tests:** (To be added - placeholder) Integration tests will be added to ensure that the frontend and backend work together correctly.

**Future Enhancements:**

*   Implement user authentication and authorization.
*   Add support for due dates and priorities.
*   Integrate with a calendar application.
*   Implement drag-and-drop task reordering.
